## Getting set up 
## This loads the Facebook group data as a list of dictionaries
posts = json.load(open('hw5feed.json'))['data']


## This extracts 3 dictionaries from the list of posts, which you will use
## as examples throughout the homework

mypost1 = posts[2]            # this is a post with one comment
mypost2 = posts[26]           # this is post without comments
mypost3 = posts[24]           # this is a post with likes

## Here is what a post dictionary looks like
print "==== example post ===="
print pretty(mypost1)

## posts is a list of dictionaries
print 'there are', len(posts), 'posts!'

### Building Block 1
## extracting the name of a poster
gap('building block 1')

## write code that extracts and prints the data associated with the 'from'
## key in mypost1
#<your-code-here
for x in range(0,len(posts)):
    print posts[x]["from"]

## write code that extracts and prints the name of the user who posted mypost1
#<your-code-here>
name = mypost1["from"]["name"]
print name


## write a function postPoster() that extracts and returns the short name of
## the post from a post dictionary. 
## Use the shortname function within your function.
#<your-code-here>
def postPoster(post):
    name = post["from"]["name"]
    return shortname(name)

## uncomment the following three lines to test
print postPoster(mypost1)
print postPoster(mypost2)
print postPoster(mypost3)

####################
### Building block 2
## extracting the number of comments for a post
gap('building block 2')

## some posts have comments
print mypost1['comments']

## other posts don't
## if you uncomment the following line, you'll get a
## key error -- the comments key isn't defined when
## there are no comments
#print mypost2['comments']

## here are what comment dictionaries look like
gap("a post's comment data structure")
print pretty(mypost1['comments'])

## this is how you get the number of comments from a comment dictionary
## if, and only if, that dictionary has comments (otherwise you get
## an error)
print "Comment count:", len(mypost1['comments']['data'])

## write a function called postCommentCount() that extracts and
## returns the number of comments from a post dictionary.
#<your-code-here>
def postCommentCount(post):
    if "comments" in post.keys():
        return len(post['comments']['data'])
    else:
        return 0

## uncomment the following two lines of code. they should print 1 and 0
print postCommentCount(mypost1)
print postCommentCount(mypost2)

### Building block 3
# extracting like counts (this similar to comment counts, but
# the likes dictionary will be missing if there are no likes)

## here are what 'like' dictionaries contains
gap("a post's likes data structure")
print pretty(mypost3['likes'])

## but some posts don't have likes. You get an error when
## you uncomment the following line
#print pretty(mypost1['likes'])

## write code that gets the number of likes from mypost3
#<your-code-here>
print len(mypost3['likes']['data'])

## write a function called postLikeCount() that extracts and
## returns the number of likes from a post dictionary
## if the dictionary does not contain any likes, it should return 0
#<your-code-here>
def postLikeCount(post):
    if "likes" in post.keys():
        return len(post['likes']['data'])
    else:
        return 0

## the following two lines should print 0 and 10 when uncommented
print postLikeCount(mypost1)
print postLikeCount(mypost3)

### Putting it all together
# Print out one line for each post in the dataset using the 3 functions
# that you have written(postPoster(), postCommentCount(), postLikeCount())
# Your output should look like:
#   Shortname posted to the group and received X comments and Y likes
#   with one line per post
gap("Task")
#<your-code-here>
for x in range(0,len(posts)):
    print postPoster(posts[x]) + " posted to the group and recieved " +str(postCommentCount(posts[x])) + " comments and " + str(postLikeCount(posts[x])) + " likes"
